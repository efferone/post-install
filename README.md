# post-install

Slowly moving some scripts over from Gitea as I make them fit for human consumption


A script I use after a fresh installation modified for others to use (user input etc)

Plan to add support for more distros soon.

Also going to add other config options, i.e for the desktop environment, power manager settings etc.


If you want to try it out:

```chmod +x post_install.sh```

```./post_install.sh```
